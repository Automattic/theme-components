# Contributing

Hey there! Thanks for wanting to contribute to Components—you rock!

## Choosing the right repo

Components is split into two repos. This repo is for the source code—all the
files that go into making up our starter themes. The code for the generator that
puts all these pieces together and builds a starter theme is in
https://github.com/Automattic/components.underscores.me.

If your issue is related to how your starter theme was built—if the name is
wrong, or if you got an error in your download file, your issue is probably
related to the [generator repo](https://github.com/Automattic/components.underscores.me).
If your issue is with the theme code itself, it probably belongs here.

If you're not entirely sure where your bug belongs, that's okay! Go ahead and
file a bug, and we'll make sure it's in the right spot.

## Creating an issue

If you find a bug or would like something added to the Components library, create a new issue! To create a new issue:

1. **Search** existing issues first to ensure your issue hasn't already been reported.
2. **Create** the issue. If it's a bug, provide steps to recreate the issue. (Attaching a video or screenshot is a great way to visually show what you're seeing.) If your issue is an enhancement, attach a mockup or sketch to explain your idea.
3. **Pull Request** If you have found a bug and can fix it, attach a pull request to your issue! See below for more details on submitting PRs.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. Think about whether your idea
fits with the [scope and aims of the project](https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components/wiki/History).
It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's
developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much
detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a great
help. They should remain focused in scope and shouldn't contain unrelated
commits.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project with
regard to indentation, accurate comments, etc. Components follows
the [WordPress coding conventions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the
project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/theme-components
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd theme-components
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new feature branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits, if necessary, before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your feature branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

## Conventions of commit messages

The first line of your commit should be a short (fewer than 50 characters)
summary of what your commit does. Commit messages should be capitalised and use
the imperative mood: "fix bug", not "fixed bug" or "fixes bug."  

To add further information or context, enter a blank new line and start a new
paragraph below, wrapping lines so they don't get too long.

To reference an issue in a commit message, include its issue number: `see #123`.
To close an issue in a commit message, use a [keyword](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
: `fixes #123`.

Here's an example of a great commit message:

```
Improve widget performance by adding more weevils.

This adds six extra weevils to our vermin stack, effectively freeing up some
of our older, rustier-kneed widgets for glue manufacturing. Fixes #123. See also #666, #21.
```

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

Thanks for helping make Components better!
