# Contributing to Theme Pattern Library
Hey, it’s really great you want to contribute to the Theme Pattern Library! Before you dive right in, we have a few pointers on how to contribute whilst it’s on Github.

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Here are some good ideas for commit messages:
- Keep them to a one line summary.
- Keep them short (50 chars or less).
- Make them relevant to the commit.

## Commit Process
All changes happen through a pull request made by contributors, ideally associated with an issue. After you send your proposed changes, one of the committers will review and test. After that we can merge them in.
