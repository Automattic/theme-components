# [Components](http://components.underscores.me)

A library of shareable, reusable patterns for WordPress themes. This project
allows you to generate different types of starter themes in order to get up and
running quickly with theme development.

This repo contains our theme components—all the pieces of code that go into making
up a theme. The code that runs [the Components site](http://components.underscores.me)
and generates the starter themes lives in a [different repo](https://github.com/Automattic/components.underscores.me).

Components was forked from [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) with the
intention of creating a more modular, pattern-based approach the theme
development. It's still very much a work in progress. Please read the wiki to
get a sense of the project's history and aims, as well as our plans for the
future. If you have questions, ideas, or patterns you'd like to share, please
[contribute a pull request or open a new issue](https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
