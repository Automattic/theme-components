# [Components](http://components.underscores.me)

A library of shareable, reusable patterns for WordPress themes. This project allows
you to generate different types of starter themes in order to get up and running
quickly with theme development.

Components was forked from [_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) with the intention of creating a more modular, pattern-based approach the theme development. It's still very much a work in progress. Please read the wiki to get a sense of the project's history and aims, as well as our plans for the future. If you have questions, ideas, or patterns you'd like to share, please [contribute a pull request or open a new issue](https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
